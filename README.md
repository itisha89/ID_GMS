# **Instructional Design Sample Project â€“ Goldman Sachs Platform Solutions**

This repository showcases my work on the **Goldman Sachs Platform Solutions Instructional Design Sample Project**. The project was designed to assess my instructional design skills by developing a training solution to address specific learning needs. The task was to create a training plan, complete with learning objectives, a mockup of the training module, and an evaluation strategy.

---

## **Project Overview**
The goal of this project was to design an instructional solution for **Data Security and Privacy Compliance** training, focusing on the importance of secure data handling and the critical aspects of data protection.

### **Key Deliverables:**
- **Storyboard**: A document that outlines the training plan, including:
  - **Learning Objectives**: Clear, actionable outcomes for what participants should know, do, or feel.
  - **Training Modalities**: A detailed breakdown of the content, including e-learning and instructor-led training components.
  - **Evaluation Strategy**: Methods to assess the effectiveness of the training solution.

---

## **File in Repository**
- **Storyboard.pdf**: This is the primary deliverable for the project, containing the **training plan**, **learning objectives**, **training mockup**, and **evaluation strategy**.

---

## **Project Components**
1. **Needs Analysis**:  
   The storyboard includes an analysis document with questions to determine if training is the appropriate solution. It outlines the rationale for the training design.

2. **Training Plan**:  
   The training plan includes:
   - **Learning Objectives**: Focused on measurable outcomes for learners.
   - **Training Modalities**: A combination of **e-learning** and **ILT** strategies to ensure engagement and effectiveness.
   - **Evaluation Strategy**: Pre- and post-training assessments, knowledge checks, and feedback mechanisms to measure success.

3. **Mockups**:  
   The storyboard contains sample slides that represent a **mockup of the training module**, including interactive and informative content such as:
   - **E-learning Slide**: Visual representation of the e-learning module content.
   - **Instructor-Led Training (ILT)**: Sample PowerPoint slides for facilitator-led sessions.
